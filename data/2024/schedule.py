In a highly connected future, use-cases for integration (or interfacing) between vehicular systems and critical infrastructure introduce a range of new threat vectors for attackers to exploit. As a result, there is an increasing need for standardisation which demands these critical infrastructure space, a look into the history of connectivity in operational technology environments (and its security implications), and the relevance of critical infrastructure to autonomous vehicular systems in relevant sectors.

While this model has many advantages, bridging IT and OT domains also invites new threats that challenge our existing security methods. Specifically, the convergence of IT and OT challenges how we perform and secure cross-domain communications. Many organisations lack the knowledge, expertise and technical rigour required to do cross-domain security effectively. This presentation explores the problem of cross-domain security in onverged IT/OT by first defining the problem, then describing the requirements and components of a cross-domain solution (CDS) for converged IT/OT, and finally, providing a CDS reference architecture for converged IT/OT based on best practice from industry and government.",
