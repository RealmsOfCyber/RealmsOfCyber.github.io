# (Realms of Cyber conference) is an expansion on our previous, wildly successful, Autohackers conference. We are a think-tank, conference, and hacker meet with a focus on the physical domains.
# We see a future where land, air, sea, space, cognitive, and biotechnological industries are well supported to make the Australian digital world safer. Our vision is simple: to help everyone grow and protect against online threats. We're here to make sure that cyber professionals and those who need their support can easily connect, creating a strong and united community that keeps our digital spaces secure and thriving.
# ROCCON (previously Autohackers) ran our first conference in Brisbane. We established in August 2022 in response to a greater perceived need to explore and foster ethical security research into land, sea, air, and space vehicles.
