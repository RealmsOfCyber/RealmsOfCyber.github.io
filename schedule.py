One of those was the Sonos Era 300 smart speaker, which earned them USD 30,000 and 3 Master of Pwn points after being the second team to exploit it. This talk covers their experience preparing for the competition—from dealing with last-minute firmware changes to the unlucky demo draw that shaped their outcome. Kylie will also introduce the exploit developed for the Sonos Era 300 and share insights into breaking a modern smart speaker. If you’re curious about embedded exploitation or what it’s like behind the scenes at Pwn2Own, this talk is for you."
