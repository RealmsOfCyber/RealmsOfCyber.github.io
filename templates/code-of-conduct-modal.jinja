                  Realms of Cyber is proud to support the IN Security
                  Movement, and acknowledges IN Security for its Code of
                  Conduct Template. See
                  <a href="https://jane-frankland.mykajabi.com/in-security-code-of-conduct">IN Security - The Code of
                    Conduct</a>

                <p>
                  Security events present opportunities to learn, share
                  knowledge and network. As a security event organiser, we
                  believe these events should represent a safe, enjoyable and
                  inclusive environment for all people, irrespective of
                  gender, race, ethnicity, age, sexuality, religion,
                  disability, socioeconomic background, experience, size,
                  shape and so on. No one should undergo harassment, bullying
                  or abuse. Any sign of such behaviour will be deemed
                  unacceptable and will be handled in line with our
                  zero-tolerance policy. We will apply consistent, specific
                  sanctions regardless of the circumstances to ensure they do
                  not reoccur. This code of conduct explains exactly what we
                  mean by unacceptable behaviour and it outlines the steps
                  someone subjected to such behaviour at an event can take to
                  report it.
                </p>
                <h4 class="meta fw-bold">
                  Why do we need a Code of Conduct?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, unacceptable behaviour still occurs and
                  whilst harassment metrics are yet to be introduced and
                  measured, anecdotal reports are widespread and have been
                  reported in the media and social media platforms for years.
                  This has reportedly resulted in increased dissatisfaction
                  and non-attendance by some minorities who feel
                  disenfranchised and threatened. The purpose of this code of
                  conduct is to get participants fully aligned on what
                  constitutes unacceptable behaviour, how the aggrieved can
                  report it, and what will be done about it.
                </p>
                <h4 class="meta fw-bold">Who is our Code of Conduct for?</h4>
                <p>
                  Our code of conduct is for event attendees, speakers,
                  sponsors, partners, facilities staff, committee, and board
                  members.

                  How we Define Acceptable and Unacceptable Behaviour
                </h4>
                <p>
                  People's interpretation of acceptable or unacceptable
                  behaviour is subjective and influenced by personal
                  experience, religion and cultural background. That's why we
                  believe it's important to define what we mean by both.
                </p>
                <h4 class="meta fw-bold">Acceptable Behaviour</h4>
                <p>
                  As an event organiser, we expect everyone to be professional
                  and respectful to others at all times. Everyone should be
                  aware of the impact their behaviour can have on others. We
                  ask that you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Respect the venue, the staff and any equipment you may be
                    allowed to use.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Be courteous and well-mannered when speaking to someone or
                    engaging with them.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Treat people the same way you would like to be treated.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Respect someone's personal space and body - when someone
                    says no it is no, not maybe.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="meta fw-bold">Unacceptable Behaviour</h4>
                <p>
                  Unacceptable behaviour is offensive in nature - it disturbs,
                  upsets or threatens. It lowers self-esteem or causes
                  overwhelming torment. It is characteristically and can take
                  the following forms:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Derogatory, inflammatory or discriminatory language,
                    comments or conduct.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Engineered episodes of intimidation, aggressive actions or
                    repeated gestures.
                  </li>
                  <li>Repetitive heckling and disruption of talks.</li>
                  <li>
                    Presenting staff or volunteers in inappropriate attire
                    e.g. sexualised clothing.
                  </li>
                  <li>Using sexual images or sex toys in public spaces.</li>
                  <li>
                    Inappropriate photography or recordings (where
                    inappropriate is defined as used later in a sexual,
                    derogatory or defamatory manner or for exploitation).
                  </li>
                  <li>Stalking or following.</li>
                  <li>Persistent and unwanted sexual advances.</li>
                  <li>Unwanted physical contact.</li>
                  <li>Encouraging any of the above behaviours.</li>

                  How to Report Unacceptable Behaviour
                </h4>
                <ol>
                  <li class="pb-2">
                    Speak up. See it, say it, sort it. If you are
                    disrespected, or witness this happening to someone else,
                    engage politely with the person involved, if you feel able
                    to, and let them know that you find their behaviour
                    unacceptable and offensive. Sometimes the best way to
                    change unacceptable behaviour is by bringing it to the
                    perpetrator's attention and giving them an opportunity to
                    acknowledge this and apologise.

                    When reporting, please provide as much detail as possible,

                        steps taken to prevent a similar instance from
                        occurring etc..)

                  <b>Note:</b> You can remain anonymous if you so wish and
                  providing any of the above information is optional. We don't
                  have a time limit for reporting unacceptable behaviour,
                  although we encourage you to do it as quickly as possible,
                  as it can be difficult to obtain accurate witness statements
                  the longer time passes. If you report unacceptable behaviour
                  more than 3-months after an incident, you should explain why
                  as it may impact the ability to respond accordingly. We will
                  consider your explanation and then endeavour to deal with
                  your report.

                <h4 class="meta fw-bold">Our Process</h4>
                <p>
                  We are committed to ensuring that you experience a positive,
                  enjoyable and inclusive event. We strive for customer
                  service excellence when reporting unacceptable behaviour.
                  That's why, for the duration of our event, we will have a
                  number of reporting mechanisms available (e.g. suitable
                  informed event staff , event feedback forms etc.). When you
                  report unacceptable behaviour to us we will respond promptly
                  and with care, consideration and respect. Our process does
                  not replace nor remove the formal mechanisms available to
                  you as an individual to report inappropriate or offensive
                  behaviour such as making a police report.
                </p>
                <p>Our process is as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    We will acknowledge your report and reply via email within
                    4 hours.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We will perform a thorough investigation within 2 weeks.
                    We will not comment on your experience or perception of
                    it. We will keep it wholly professional and confidential.
                    We will treat all of the people involved fairly and
                    objectively, irrespective of what our relationship with
                    them is.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We will apply the appropriate sanctions / remediations
                    e.g. warnings, direction to learning resources on the
                    topic of harassment, bullying or anti-social behaviour,
                    temporary or permanent suspensions, and if necessary
                    report them to the police. We will take into consideration
                    your wishes in any enforcement.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We will suggest measures we can take to ensure incidents
                    of this nature do not reoccur at future events.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We reserve the right to remove people from the event, or
                    prevent people from joining the event.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We will not name and shame individuals, but we will
                    analyse our progress with regards to unacceptable
                    behaviour and publish our findings annually on our
                    website.
